## [3.1.1] - 2025-08-30

### 📚 Documentation Accuracy Update
**Minor Release**: Updated documentation to accurately reflect current application functionality and status.

#### ✨ Documentation Corrections
- **Plugin Architecture Status**: Corrected from "complete" to "foundation complete, migration in progress"
- **Enhanced Scraper Reality**: Clarified that enhanced scraper focuses on specific sources, not all sources
- **Data Source Accuracy**: Updated success rates and source status to match actual application behavior
- **Current Application State**: Added accurate assessment of what actually works vs. what has limitations

#### 🎯 Key Clarifications
- **Plugin System**: Foundation complete but not yet integrated into main application
- **Data Sources**: Mix of live APIs (95%+), enhanced scraping (90%+), and web scraping (70-80%)
- **Source Status**: Many sources marked as "sample" due to access limitations
- **Migration Status**: Architecture ready, existing scrapers still use legacy system
