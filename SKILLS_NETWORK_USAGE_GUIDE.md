## üåê Skills Network Tab

### What You'll See
The Skills Network tab provides an interactive visualization showing:

- **Skill Nodes** - Circles representing individual skills
- **Connections** - Lines showing which skills commonly appear together
- **Node Sizes** - Larger nodes = more frequent skills
- **Node Colors** - Color-coded by skill demand level
- **Interactive Features** - Click, hover, and explore connections

### How to Use

#### Step 1: Access the Network
1. Click the "üåê Skills Network" tab
2. The network will automatically load with your search data
3. If no search data is available, sample data will be shown

#### Step 2: Explore the Network
- **Click on any node** to highlight its connections
- **Hover over nodes** to see skill details
- **Drag nodes** to rearrange the layout
- **Zoom in/out** using mouse wheel or pinch gestures
- **Double-click empty space** to reset the view

#### Step 3: Use the Controls
The network includes several control options:

**Filter Controls:**
- **Min Skill Frequency** - Show only skills mentioned X+ times
- **Min Co-occurrence** - Show only connections that appear X+ times
- **Keyword Filter** - Filter by specific keywords
- **Experience Level** - Filter by job experience level

**Action Buttons:**
- **üîÑ Update Network** - Refresh with current filters
- **üîÑ Reset** - Reset all filters to defaults
- **üìä Show Experience Distribution** - View experience level breakdown

#### Step 4: Interpret the Network
- **Node Size** = Skill frequency (bigger = more common)
- **Node Color** = Skill demand level:
  - üî¥ Red = High demand (top 30%)
  - üü† Orange = Medium demand (30-60%)
  - üü° Yellow = Moderate demand (60-80%)
  - üü¢ Green = Lower demand (bottom 20%)
- **Line Thickness** = Connection strength (thicker = more co-occurrences)

### Sample Network Interpretation
```
If you see:
- Large red "Python" node connected to "Django" and "Flask"
- This means Python is highly in-demand and often paired with these frameworks
- Thick line between "React" and "JavaScript" = strong co-occurrence
- Isolated "COBOL" node = niche skill, rarely paired with others
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Experience Level Analysis
1. Use the "Experience Level" dropdown in the Skills Network tab
2. Select specific levels (Entry, Mid, Senior, Executive)
3. The network will update to show skills for that experience level
4. Click "üìä Show Experience Distribution" to see a pie chart breakdown

### Skill Relationship Insights
- **Strong Connections** = Skills that are commonly required together
- **Hub Skills** = Skills that connect to many others (versatile skills)
- **Isolated Skills** = Specialized skills with few connections
- **Skill Clusters** = Groups of related skills that form communities

### Career Path Planning
Use the network to identify:
- **Core Skills** - Essential skills for your target role
- **Complementary Skills** - Skills that pair well with your expertise
- **Skill Gaps** - Missing skills you should learn
- **Career Transitions** - Skills that bridge different roles

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No Skills Data Available"
- **Cause**: No job search performed yet
- **Solution**: Perform a job search first, then return to Skills Analysis

#### "Skills Network Not Loading"
- **Cause**: JavaScript errors or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: 
  1. Refresh the page
  2. Check browser console for errors
  3. Ensure vis-network library is loaded

#### "Sample Data Shown"
- **Cause**: No real job data available
- **Solution**: 
  1. Perform a job search with specific keywords
  2. Use "Enhanced Search" for more comprehensive results
  3. Check if your search returned any jobs

#### "Empty Network"
- **Cause**: Filters too restrictive
- **Solution**: 
  1. Lower the "Min Skill Frequency" threshold
  2. Lower the "Min Co-occurrence" threshold
  3. Clear keyword filters

### Performance Tips
- **Large Networks**: Use filters to reduce complexity
- **Slow Loading**: Try "Enhanced Search" for better data quality
- **Browser Issues**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
