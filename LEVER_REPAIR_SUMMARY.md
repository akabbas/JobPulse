# Lever Company List Repair Summary

## Overview
Attempted to repair the Lever scraper but found that **all companies return 404 errors or timeouts**, resulting in a **0% success rate**. The decision was made to **disable the Lever scraper entirely**.

## Process

### 1. Initial Testing
- **Original Issue**: 0% success rate with all companies returning 404 errors
- **Companies Tested**: stripe, coinbase, robinhood, doordash, instacart, notion, figma, linear, vercel, netlify, supabase, planetscale, github, shopify, twilio, slack
- **Results**: All 16 companies failed with 404 errors or connection timeouts

### 2. Comprehensive Repair Attempt
Created `scripts/repair_lever_companies.py` to systematically:
- Test multiple naming variations for each company
- Search for career pages to find correct identifiers
- Try known company-specific variations
- Test stock ticker variations

### 3. Alternative Company Testing
Created `scripts/test_lever_alternatives.py` to test:
- 80+ alternative company identifiers
- Common tech companies that might use Lever
- Various naming conventions and variations

### 4. Results
- **Repair Success**: 0/16 companies could be repaired
- **Alternative Testing**: 0/80+ alternative companies worked
- **Root Cause**: Companies have likely moved away from Lever to other job platforms
- **Solution**: Disable the Lever scraper entirely

## Final Configuration

### Updated Company List
```python
# DISABLED: All companies return 404 errors or timeouts (0% success rate)
# Companies have likely moved away from Lever to other platforms
self.lever_companies = []
```

### Performance Impact
- **Success Rate**: 0% (all companies broken)
- **API Response**: 404 errors or connection timeouts
- **Job Data**: No real job listings available
- **Recommendation**: Disable scraper to improve reliability

## Analysis

### Why Lever Failed
1. **Platform Migration**: Companies have moved to other job platforms (Greenhouse, Workday, etc.)
2. **API Changes**: Lever may have changed their API structure or access requirements
3. **Company Consolidation**: Many companies may have consolidated their job postings to fewer platforms
4. **Market Changes**: The job platform landscape has evolved significantly

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **API Documentation Research**: Lever's API documentation may have changed
2. **Career Page Analysis**: Companies may have moved to different platforms
3. **Platform Migration**: Companies may have switched to Greenhouse, Workday, or other platforms
4. **Manual Verification**: Each company would need individual investigation

## Impact

### Before Disabling
- ‚ùå 16 broken companies returning 404 errors
- ‚ùå 0% success rate
- ‚ùå Wasted API calls and processing time
- ‚ùå Potential for sample data fallback

### After Disabling
- ‚úÖ No more failed API calls
- ‚úÖ Faster job searches (no time wasted on broken requests)
- ‚úÖ Focus on working data sources
- ‚úÖ Improved overall reliability

## Files Modified
- `scrapers/lever_scraper.py` - Disabled company list
- `scripts/repair_lever_companies.py` - Created comprehensive repair script
- `scripts/quick_lever_test.py` - Created quick test script
- `scripts/test_lever_alternatives.py` - Created alternative testing script

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Completed**: Disable Lever scraper by setting empty company list
2. ‚úÖ **Completed**: Document the decision and reasoning
3. üîÑ **Pending**: Update data source status in `web_dashboard/app.py` to reflect "disabled" status
4. üîÑ **Pending**: Remove Lever from the UI as a data source option

### Future Considerations
1. **Monitor Lever API**: Periodically check if Lever becomes available again
2. **Alternative Platforms**: Research other job platforms that might be more reliable
3. **Company-Specific Scrapers**: Consider building individual scrapers for major companies
4. **API Documentation**: Keep track of Lever's API changes

## Conclusion
The Lever scraper has been **disabled due to 0% success rate**. All companies in the original list return 404 errors or connection timeouts, indicating that companies have likely moved away from Lever to other job platforms. Disabling the scraper improves overall system reliability and performance by eliminating failed API calls.

**Next Steps**: Focus on maintaining and improving the working scrapers (Greenhouse, Dice, Stack Overflow) and consider adding new, more reliable data sources.
