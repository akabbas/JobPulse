  ‚Ä¢ Remotive: 12 jobs in 2.45s
  ...

üéâ System Status: EXCELLENT - 90.9% of sources are healthy
```

## Health Score Calculation

The overall health score is calculated using a weighted formula:

```
Health Score = (Healthy Sources √ó 100 + Degraded Sources √ó 50) / Total Sources
```

### **Score Interpretation**
- **90-100%**: EXCELLENT - System performing optimally
- **70-89%**: GOOD - Minor issues, generally healthy
- **50-69%**: FAIR - Some sources need attention
- **0-49%**: POOR - Critical issues requiring immediate action

## Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
- **Concurrent Testing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel API calls
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout per source to prevent hanging
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of connection errors and timeouts
- **Color Output**: Cross-platform colored output using colorama

### **Key Components**

#### **HealthResult Class**
```python
@dataclass
class HealthResult:
    source_name: str
    status: str  # 'healthy', 'degraded', 'offline'
    jobs_found: int
    response_time: float
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    test_query: str = "software engineer"
    location: str = "United States"
```

#### **JobPulseHealthChecker Class**
- **test_data_source()**: Tests individual data sources
- **run_health_checks()**: Executes all health checks concurrently
- **print_results_table()**: Displays formatted results
- **print_summary_stats()**: Shows comprehensive statistics
- **print_recommendations()**: Provides actionable insights

### **Configuration**
- **Base URL**: Configurable server endpoint (default: http://localhost:5002)
- **Test Query**: Configurable search term (default: "software engineer")
- **Timeout**: Configurable request timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- **Concurrency**: Configurable parallel workers (default: 5)

## Demo Mode

The demo version (`health_check_demo.py`) provides:
- **No Server Required**: Shows expected results without running the server
- **Realistic Data**: Uses realistic job counts and response times
- **Full Feature Demo**: Demonstrates all dashboard features
- **Educational**: Shows what a healthy system looks like

## Integration with CI/CD

The health check system can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines:

```bash
# Run health check and exit with appropriate code
python scripts/health_check.py
exit_code=$?

if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Health check passed"
elif [ $exit_code -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Health check warning"
    exit 1
else
    echo "‚ùå Health check failed"
    exit 2
fi
```

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success (60%+ sources healthy)
- **1**: Warning (40-59% sources healthy)
- **2**: Error (Health check failed to run)

## Best Practices

### **For Demos**
1. **Run Demo First**: Use `health_check_demo.py` to show expected results
2. **Start Server**: Ensure JobPulse server is running
3. **Run Real Check**: Execute `health_check.py` for live results
4. **Highlight Success**: Focus on high health scores and reliable sources

### **For Monitoring**
1. **Regular Checks**: Run health checks periodically (hourly/daily)
2. **Alert Thresholds**: Set up alerts for health scores below 70%
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track health scores over time
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of issues and resolutions

### **For Development**
1. **Pre-Deployment**: Run health checks before deploying changes
2. **Post-Deployment**: Verify system health after deployments
3. **Debugging**: Use health check results to identify problematic sources
4. **Performance**: Monitor response times for optimization opportunities

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Server Not Running**
```
‚ùå Cannot connect to JobPulse server
üí° Make sure the server is running: python web_dashboard/app.py
```

**Solution**: Start the JobPulse server before running health checks.

#### **Timeout Errors**
```
üîç Testing Source... ‚ùå TIMEOUT
```

**Solution**: Check network connectivity and server performance.

#### **Connection Errors**
```
üîç Testing Source... ‚ùå CONNECTION ERROR
```

**Solution**: Verify server is accessible and firewall settings.

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Reduce Concurrency**: Lower max_workers if experiencing timeouts
- **Increase Timeout**: Extend timeout for slower sources
- **Cache Results**: Implement caching for frequently checked sources
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple health check instances for large systems

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Historical Tracking**: Store health check results over time
- **Alerting System**: Email/Slack notifications for critical issues
- **Web Dashboard**: Browser-based health monitoring interface
- **API Endpoint**: REST API for health check results
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined health criteria
- **Integration**: Connect with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

### **Advanced Monitoring**
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in system health
- **Predictive Alerts**: Anticipate issues before they occur
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish normal operating ranges
- **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing for common issues
