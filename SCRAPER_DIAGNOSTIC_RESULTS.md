- `diagnostic_screenshots/stackoverflow_jobs_page.png` - Shows current Stack Overflow page structure

## 🔧 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Phase 1: Fix API-Based Scrapers (Easier)**

#### **Greenhouse Scraper**
1. **Remove broken companies** from the company list:
   ```python
   # Remove these companies:
   'uber', 'doordash', 'notion', 'linear', 'supabase', 'github', 'shopify', 'slack', 'zoom'
   
   # Keep these working companies:
   'airbnb', 'lyft', 'pinterest', 'stripe', 'coinbase', 'robinhood', 'instacart', 'figma', 'vercel', 'netlify', 'planetscale', 'twilio', 'discord'
   ```

2. **Test the updated list** to ensure success rate improves to >80%

#### **Lever Scraper**
1. **Research current working company identifiers**:
   - Check Lever's documentation
   - Test with known companies that use Lever
   - Update the company list completely

2. **Verify API structure** hasn't changed

### **Phase 2: Fix HTML-Based Scrapers (More Complex)**

#### **Dice Scraper**
1. **Examine the screenshot** `diagnostic_screenshots/dice_jobs_page.png`
2. **Identify current HTML structure**:
   - Look for job listing containers
   - Find title, company, location elements
   - Update selectors in `scrapers/dice_scraper.py`

3. **Test updated selectors** with Playwright

#### **Stack Overflow Scraper**
1. **Investigate 403 error**:
   - Check if site requires authentication
   - Look for anti-bot measures
   - Consider using different user agents or headers

2. **Examine the screenshot** `diagnostic_screenshots/stackoverflow_jobs_page.png`
3. **Update HTML selectors** based on current structure

## 🎯 **Priority Order**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Greenhouse scraper (remove broken companies)
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Research and fix Lever scraper company list
3. **LOW PRIORITY**: Fix Dice and Stack Overflow HTML selectors

## 📊 **Expected Outcomes After Fixes**
