4. **JavaScript Rendering**: Handles dynamic content
5. **Network Delays**: Respects rate limits with delays

### **Code Structure**
```python
class WorkingPlaywrightScraper:
    async def _init_browser(self):
        # Initialize headless browser
    
    async def scrape_remote_ok_playwright(self):
        # Scrape Remote OK with Playwright
    
    async def scrape_weworkremotely_playwright(self):
        # Scrape We Work Remotely with Playwright
