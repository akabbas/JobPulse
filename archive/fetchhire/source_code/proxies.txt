# Proxy Configuration File
# Add your proxy servers here, one per line
# Format: http://username:password@proxy_host:port
# Example:
# http://user:pass@proxy1.example.com:8080
# http://user:pass@proxy2.example.com:8080
# https://user:pass@proxy3.example.com:3128

# Free proxy examples (replace with your own paid proxies for better reliability)
# http://proxy1.example.com:8080
# http://proxy2.example.com:8080
# http://proxy3.example.com:3128

# Note: Free proxies are often unreliable and may be blocked by job sites
# For production use, consider using paid proxy services like:
# - Bright Data (formerly Luminati)
# - SmartProxy
# - Oxylabs
# - ProxyMesh
# - Rotating proxies from cloud providers
