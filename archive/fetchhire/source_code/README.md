# 🚀 FetchHire - Advanced Job Scraper with 403 Error Bypass

A sophisticated web scraping solution that bypasses anti-bot protection using Playwright headless browser technology. Built with Python, Flask, and modern web scraping techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Challenge**: Traditional web scrapers get blocked by 403 Forbidden errors from job sites like LinkedIn, Remote OK, and We Work Remotely due to anti-bot protection.

**Solution**: Implemented Playwright headless browser technology that mimics real user behavior, successfully bypassing all 403 errors while maintaining ethical scraping practices.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔓 **403 Error Bypass**: Uses Playwright headless browser to bypass anti-bot protection
- 🎯 **Skills Extraction**: Automatically extracts tech skills from job descriptions
- 📊 **Data Analytics**: Provides job market insights and skills analysis
- 🚀 **Async Processing**: Concurrent scraping for improved performance
- 💾 **Database Integration**: Stores results in Snowflake for analysis
- 🔄 **Duplicate Removal**: Intelligent deduplication of job postings
- 📈 **Real-time Analytics**: Live dashboard with job market trends

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.13, Flask
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright, BeautifulSoup4, Requests
- **Database**: Snowflake
- **Async Processing**: asyncio, aiohttp
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, JSON
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite

  }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 403 Error Bypass Strategy

1. **Headless Browser**: Uses Playwright with real Chrome browser
2. **User Agent Rotation**: Randomizes browser identity
3. **Proper Headers**: Sets realistic browser headers
4. **JavaScript Rendering**: Handles dynamic content
5. **Network Delays**: Respects rate limits ethically

### Code Example

```python
class WorkingPlaywrightScraper:
    async def _init_browser(self):
        """Initialize Playwright browser with anti-detection measures"""
        self.browser = await self.playwright.chromium.launch(
            headless=True,
            args=['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
        )
        
    async def scrape_remote_ok_playwright(self):
        """Scrape Remote OK using Playwright (bypasses 403)"""
        await self.page.goto("https://remoteok.com/remote-dev-jobs")
        # Extract job data with BeautifulSoup
        # Returns structured job data
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Success Rate**: 95%+ (bypasses all 403 errors)
- **Speed**: 30-60 seconds for full scrape
- **Data Quality**: Clean, structured JSON output
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple sources concurrently

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Job Market Analysis**: Track trending skills and salaries
- **Recruitment**: Source candidates from multiple platforms
- **Market Research**: Analyze job posting patterns
- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identify in-demand technologies
